# RetailEase-Corp-SQL-Code
## Description:
In this SQL project, I analyzed customer transactions at RetailEase Corp. to uncover actionable insights for driving business growth by integrating and querying datasets on Customers, Transactions, and Products. I identified Customer Insights, Sales Performance, and Operational Improvements. This analysis addressed key business challenges, such as improving customer retention and optimizing product offerings. Additionally, I highlighted revenue growth opportunities by pinpointing underperforming product categories and targeting high-value customers.
## Problem Statement:
The project aims to analyze customer demographics, purchasing trends, and sales performance by category, location, and season using SQL. It will provide insights on top customers, and recommend optimization strategies for discounts, promo codes, and shipping to enhance operational efficiency.
## Features:
Technologies Used: SSMS (ETL and Query Development/Execution), Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, CASE Statement.
## Objectives:
### Customer Insights:
* The company lacks a clear understanding of customer demographics (age, gender, subscription status) and purchase behaviors.
* They want to identify which customers are the most loyal and which groups tend to spend more.
### Sales Performance:
* There is no clarity on the performance of specific product categories across locations.
* They want to know the impact of discounts and promo codes on sales and determine whether certain payment methods are more commonly used.
### Operational Bottlenecks:
* The shipping team is unsure which shipping types (e.g., Standard, Express) are most popular and whether they correlate with customer satisfaction (review ratings).
* Management wants to identify which seasons generate the highest revenue and which product sizes or colors are most in demand.
## Design Thinking:
The design thinking approach for this project involves empathizing with RetailEase’s challenges, defining key business objectives, ideating data-driven solutions, analyzing datasets to uncover insights, and iteratively prototyping strategies to address retention, optimize offerings, and target high-value customers. The goal is to align actionable insights with the company’s strategic growth vision.
## Insights:
* The average customer age at RetailEase Corp. is 44, aligning with Gen X. This suggests that products should cater to the preferences of Gen X consumers, appealing to both male and female shoppers in this age range.
* RetailEase Corp. has a strong customer base, with 36 individuals ranking among the top 5 by total purchase amount, indicating a substantial number of high-profile shoppers.
* Free shipping is the most common shipping type, indicating customers’ preference for it. To enhance customer satisfaction, focus on maintaining high-quality service while optimizing operations for this favored delivery method.
* Clothing generates the highest revenue, indicating a priority area for restocking to maximize profitability.
* Items sold without promo codes generated significantly higher revenue than those with promo codes, suggesting that eliminating promo code usage could improve overall profitability.
## Conclusion:
The project leverages SQL to deliver actionable insights on customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency. Key findings include identifying top subscription statuses, loyal customer locations, and high-revenue products and seasons. The analysis also highlights trends in payment methods, shipping preferences, and promotional impacts. Advanced ranking and aggregation techniques provide a clear understanding of revenue drivers and bottlenecks, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing business strategies.
